In Lab 2 we will look at mapping growth across space and time.

In addition to the database that we have used so far, we can introduce more data from Eurostat.

You can have a look at their nice interactive web-based tool [here or in the iframe below](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/cache/RCI/#?vis=nuts2.scitech&lang=en) and download the data in excel format from my Github [here](https://github.com/j-jayes/EOSE09-site/raw/main/resources/adm-resources/regions_illustrated.csv).

```{r}
#| column: page
#| out-width: "100%"
knitr::include_url("https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/cache/RCI/#?vis=nuts2.economy&lang=en", height = 800)
```

I will download the earliest values from each series and put it up later this week (before January 27), until then, you can get an idea of the data from the link above.

This is what the data looks like:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
theme_set(theme_light())
library(sf)
library(gt)

df <- read_rds(here::here("resources/adm-resources/regions_illustrated.rds")) %>% 
  rename(nuts_code = code)
  
map <- read_rds(here::here("resources/adm-resources/map_simple.rds"))

df_map <- df %>% 
  inner_join(map)
```

## Series

```{r}
df_map %>%
  filter(period == "late") %>% 
  group_by(stat_domain) %>%
  count(indicator) %>%
  select(-n) %>%
  gt() %>%
  tab_style(
    style = list(
      cell_fill(color = "#191970"),
      cell_text(color = "white")
    ),
    locations = cells_row_groups(groups = everything())
  ) %>%
  tab_header(title = md("**List of indicators**")) %>%
  tab_options(column_labels.hidden = T)
```

## Plots

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| code-fold: true

plot_levels <- function(indicator_in, period_in) {
  df_map %>%
    filter(
      indicator == indicator_in,
      period == period_in
    ) %>%
    ggplot(aes(fill = value, geometry = geometry)) +
    geom_sf() +
    coord_sf() +
    scale_fill_viridis_c(labels = scales::number_format()) +
    labs(fill = indicator_in) +
    theme(legend.position = "bottom") +
    guides(fill = guide_colourbar(title.position = "top", title.hjust = 0.5, barwidth = 20)) +
    labs(title = indicator_in)
}

plot_pc <- function(indicator_in, period_in) {
  stat_domain_in <- df_map %>%
    filter(
      indicator == indicator_in,
      period == period_in
    ) %>%
    distinct(stat_domain) %>%
    pull()


  df_map %>%
    filter(
      indicator %in% c(indicator_in, "Population (persons)"),
      period == period_in,
      stat_domain == stat_domain_in
    ) %>%
    distinct(region, indicator, value, .keep_all = T) %>%
    group_by(region) %>%
    mutate(value_pc = value[indicator == indicator_in] / value[indicator == "Population (persons)"]) %>%
    ggplot(aes(fill = value_pc, geometry = geometry)) +
    geom_sf() +
    coord_sf() +
    scale_fill_viridis_c(labels = scales::number_format()) +
    labs(
      fill = str_c(indicator_in, " per capita"),
      title = str_c(indicator_in, " per capita")
    ) +
    theme(legend.position = "bottom") +
    guides(fill = guide_colourbar(title.position = "top", title.hjust = 0.5, barwidth = 20))
}

plot_scatter <- function(indicator_in, period_in) {
  df_map %>%
    filter(
      indicator %in% c(indicator_in, "Gross domestic product (Euro per inhabitant)"),
      period == period_in
    ) %>%
    distinct(region, indicator, .keep_all = T) %>%
    select(-c(stat_domain, year)) %>%
    pivot_wider(names_from = indicator, values_from = value) %>%
    mutate(country = fct_lump(country, 10)) %>%
    ggplot(aes(
      x = `Gross domestic product (Euro per inhabitant)`,
      y = .data[[indicator_in]],
      colour = country
    )) +
    geom_point() +
    geom_smooth(aes(group = 1), se = F) +
    scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::dollar_format(prefix = "â‚¬")) +
    labs(
      colour = "Country",
      title = str_c("Scatterplot of GDP per capita and\n", indicator_in)
    )
}

### Agriculture

What can we say about milk production? Look at Switzerland go!

```{r}
plot_levels("Production of cow milk on farms (1 000 tonnes)", "early")
```

How about sheep farming? Sheesh have a look at Crete!

```{r}
plot_pc("Livestock farming, Live sheep", "early")
```

There isn't a super clear relationship between number of cows and GDP per capita. Good news that you can farm in a rich country still!

```{r}
plot_scatter("Livestock farming, Dairy cows", "early")
```

### Economy

Why does Turkey have such a low level of employment among women?

```{r}
plot_levels("Employment rate, Females (% of population aged 20-64)", "late") +
  scale_fill_viridis_c(labels = scales::percent_format())
```

It seems that there is a strong relationship between GDP per capita and the economic activity rate. Can you guess about the direction of causality?

```{r}
plot_scatter("Economic activity rate (% of population aged 15-64)", "early")
```

Do we see agglomeration effects with higher GDP per capita in areas with higher population density? Note the logged y axis.

```{r}
plot_scatter("Population density (persons per square kilometre)", "early") +
  scale_y_log10() +
  labs(y = "Population density (persons per square kilometre)\n(Log scale)")
```

### Education

Look at how well Scandinavia compares to Western Europe in rates of university education among women!

(I don't know why France is mising...)

```{r}
plot_levels("Tertiary educational attainment, Females (% of population aged 25-64)", "early") +
  scale_fill_viridis_c(labels = scales::percent_format())
```

Who leaves school early? Maybe people in places where formal education is not that enticing?

```{r}
plot_levels("Early leavers from education and training (% of population aged 18-24)", "early")
```

Look at how the countries separate here - wow!

```{r}
plot_scatter("Employment rate of recent graduates (% of population aged 20-34)", "early") +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format())
```

### Health

See how few hospital beds Sweden has compared to Norway.

```{r}
plot_levels("Hospital beds (per 100 000 inhabitants)", "early")
```

Seems like you have to be a rich country in order to live long enough to die from cancer :(

```{r}
plot_levels("Death due to cancer (crude death rate)", "early")
```

Look at how the countries separate here - wow!

```{r}
plot_scatter("Medical doctors (per 100 000 inhabitants)", "early") 
```


### Population

```{r}
plot_levels("Total fertility rate (live births per woman)", "early")
```


```{r}
plot_levels("Life expectancy at birth, Total (years)", "late")
```

Interesting demographic trends! You have to be rich enough to have children in a rich country!

```{r}
plot_scatter("Total fertility rate (live births per woman)", "early") 
```
