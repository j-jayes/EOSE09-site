This is a guide for downloading and installing Stata on your personal computer. 

If your Stata license has expired, you can follow the steps below to renew it, you do not need to download the software again, just the license file (.pdf).

## Step 1: Go to LU software downloads page

The page can be found [here](https://www.lunduniversity.lu.se/current-students/student-services-and-support/it-resources-and-assistance/software).

It looks like this (in English):

## Step 2: Log in to the LU service desk programme portal at the bottom of the page

You need to be connected to the LU network to access this page, or the LU VPN I believe. Here is the link to the [LU service desk programme portal](https://program.ldc.lu.se/).
