It is a great example of how to tell a story with data.\n\nHans Rosling was a Swedish doctor, who was passionate about using data to tell stories. He was a professor of international health at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, and he co-founded the Gapminder Foundation that was great at geting policy makers excited about data based decision making.\n\n:::\n\n## Structure\n\n::: columns\n::: {.column width=\"40%\"}\n1.

This allows us to see the distribution of the data - for each region in the dataset, we look what the value is of regional share of employment in industry, and we count that value and add it to the bin. \n\nHere we can see that all of the data lies between about 0.08 and .4 - in percentage terms that means that the share of employment in industry is between 8 and 40 percent in 2010 across our dataset.\n\n:::\n\n\n## Let's plot the distribution of the data\n\n<br>\n\n:::: columns\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](lecture-1-resources/stata_2.png){width=1452}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n:::\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nkdensity employment_share_industry if year == 2010\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n:::\n::::\n\n::: notes\n\nWe can also use what is called a kernel density plot to show the distribution of the data. This is a smoothed version of the histogram, where we can see the distribution of the data in a more continuous way.\n\nWhat can we say about the shape of the distribution?\n\n:::\n\n\n## Now let's make breaks based on this information\n\n<br>\n\n:::: columns\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](lecture-1-resources/stata_3.png){width=830}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n:::\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-line-numbers=\"5,7,8,9\"}\nspmap employment_share_industry using \"nutscoord.dta\" \n  if year == 2010, id(_ID) fcolor(Spectral) legstyle(2) \n\ttitle(\"Employment Share Industry - 2010\", size(large)) \n\tosize(0.02 ..) ocolor(white ..) \n\tclmethod(custom) clbreaks(0 (0.075) 0.45) \n\tlegend(pos(9) size(medium) rowgap(1.5) \n\tlabel(7 \"37-45 %\") label(6 \"30-37 %\") \n\tlabel(5 \"23-30 %\") label(4 \"15-23 %\") \n\tlabel(3 \"8-15 %\") label(2 \"0-8 %\") \n\tlabel(1 \"No Data\")) \n\tndfcolor(gray) ndocolor(white ..) ndsize(0.02 ..)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n:::\n::::\n\n::: notes\n\nHere instead of using the breaks covering all the way from zero to 100 percent, we trim the breaks to cover the range of the data, in this case from zero to 45 percent, which we break up into six bins. \n\nNow it is much more clear that in Paris, Copenagen, Oslo and Stockholm, there are relatively few people working in industry, (and we know that the majority work in services).\n\nIn contrast, in Northern Italy, as we spoke about yesterday, there is a strong industrial base. In the Basque country, there is a strong industrial base around Bilbao. \n\n:::\n\n## Colour scales\n\nUses of color in data visualization\n\n. . .\n\n<table style = \"border: none; line-height: 2.5;\">\n<tr style = \"background: white;\">\n<td style = \"text-align: left; width: 50%;\">\n1.

We aren't saying that this town is 'more Skane' than others, so a sequential palette is not appropriate.\n\n:::\n\n## Qualitative scale example\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](lecture-1_files/figure-revealjs/unnamed-chunk-16-1.png){fig-align='center' width=768}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nPalette name: Brewer Set1\n\n## Qualitative scale example\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](lecture-1_files/figure-revealjs/unnamed-chunk-17-1.png){fig-align='center' width=768}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nPalette name: Brewer Dark2\n\n## Uses of color in data visualization\n\n<table style = \"border: none; line-height: 2.5;\">\n<tr style = \"background: white;\">\n<td style = \"text-align: left; width: 50%;\">\n1.

I think in this case it makes sense to use the brighter end of the scale as high, because we associate it with sunlight - quite neat!!.\n\n## Sequential scale example\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](lecture-1_files/figure-revealjs/unnamed-chunk-19-1.png){fig-align='center' width=960}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nPalette name: viridis\n\n## Uses of color in data visualization\n\n<table style = \"border: none; line-height: 2.5;\">\n<tr style = \"background: white;\">\n<td style = \"text-align: left; width: 50%;\">\n1.

We want to know how far each point is away from the median value of installed solar capacity in Stockholm county - and we can see that the red values are high, and the blue values are low, while the median is a white colour. \n\nIn this case we have a log scale on the y-axis because the data is quite skewed, and we want to be able to see the differences between the points more clearly.

This way we don't need to have a legend and a title, and we can save some space on the plot. I also used the colours from the flags of the countries, which is a nice touch, if I do say so myself.\n\n:::\n\n\n## Using density plots to set your legend breaks: quick example\n\nDataset: Solar panels in Sweden\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n```{=html}\n<div id=\"bzoqhtbfnv\" style=\"padding-left:0px;padding-right:0px;padding-top:10px;padding-bottom:10px;overflow-x:auto;overflow-y:auto;width:auto;height:auto;\">\n  \n  <table class=\"gt_table\" data-quarto-disable-processing=\"false\" data-quarto-bootstrap=\"false\" style=\"-webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased;

You can all get access to the FT through Lund and I think it's a really great resource for data journalism and data visualization.\n\nMaps work best when they show an emerging spatial pattern, as was the case with this map from the recent Italian elections.\n\nShowing the winner at municipality level clearly shows the political divisions in the country. In the north, the Northern League party triumphed largely on the back of an anti-immigration and anti-EU agenda. In the south, the anti-establishment Five Star Movement was even more successful, gaining a majority of votes in many areas.\n\n\nWhat is also clever as that they have used a column chart in the map in order to help us understand the aggregate vote share for the main parties.\n\nWhat kind of palette do you think they have used here? Sequential, qualitative or diverging?\n\nA: qualitative, because they are showing the winner in each municipality.\n\n:::\n\n## Examples of great maps\n\n[Financial Times analysis of Italian election results in 2018](https://www.ft.com/content/35188c6a-4870-11e8-8ee8-cae73aab7ccb)\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](lecture-1-resources/ft_italy_elections_2.PNG){fig-align='center' width=364}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n::: notes\n\nAnother interesting take on the results was to show the per cent share of vote. This helped to emphasise just how strong the support was for the two parties.\n\nWhat kind of palette do you think they have used here? Sequential, qualitative or diverging?\n\nA: Sequential, because they are showing the share of the vote in each municipality for two main parties they want to compare.\n\nAnother thing I should mention is that they have been quite clever with the legend - you can see here the breaks are in specific places, in oder to best show that the Norhtern League's support is really concentrated in the North, and the Five Star Movement's support is really concentrated in the South and Sicily.\n\n:::\n\n## Examples of great maps\n\n[Human Terrain from The Pudding](https://pudding.cool/2018/10/city_3d/)\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](lecture-1-resources/population_southern_sweden.PNG){fig-align='center' width=928}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n::: notes\n\nThe other place I really recommend you have a look for inspiration for good data journalism is a website called \"The Pudding\". They have some really great data visualizations and data journalism pieces, inclduing this one that shows where people live in countries.\n\nHere i have a screenshow of the map showing the Oresund region, and we can see how centered the population is in Copenagenhagen and Malmo, and how the population density drops off as we move away from the cities to smaller towns.\n\nI will say that this is based on buildings and not people, so it is not a perfect representation of the population, but it is a really interesting way to show where people live in a country. Here you can see the Oresund bridge looks like it has people living on it, but that is not the case in reality. \n\nLet's have a look at some other places - who has visited Japan before?
