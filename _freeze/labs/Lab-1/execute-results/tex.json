Installing basic packages: We will go over how to install the necessary packages in order to run our analysis. This will include packages such as \"spmap\" and \"geo2xy\" which will allow us to create maps in Stata.\n\n2.  Data types: We will discuss the different types of data that we will be working with in this lab. Specifically, we will be using time series data from a spreadsheet and map data from a shapefile. It is important to understand the structure and format of these data types in order to properly analyze and visualize them.\n\n3.  Basic mapping: Once we have our data, we will learn how to draw a basic map using the \"maps\" and \"maptools\" packages. We will go over how to import the shapefile data, how to define the map scale, and how to add different layers to the map such as points, lines, and polygons.\n\nBy the end of this lab, you should have a solid understanding of how to install necessary packages, how to work with different types of data, and how to draw a basic map in Stata.\n\nüìäüó∫Ô∏èüíª Let's get started!\n\n## Getting started\n\nGiven that you have encountered Stata previously in your studies, I will not spend undue time explaining the basics. If you want to brush up on Stata's syntax, I recommend having a look at [these slides](https://github.com/j-jayes/EOSE09/blob/b8444dd95783f4434ab63c4ad28b0f3033d4fd0a/resources/StataTutorial.pdf) from Oscar Torres-Reyna, or [this set of Youtube videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXsPgQe-aqs&ab_channel=SebastianWaiEcon) From Sebastian Wai. I've put together a comprehensive set of resources on [this page here](../resources/resources.qmd).\n\n### Install additional programs and set-up\n\nFirst we need to install the packages in Stata that we will make use of. Please do this before our lab session in order to save time.\n\nWe use the `ssc install` command, as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nssc install spmap, replace\nssc install geo2xy, replace\nssc install shp2dta, replace\nssc install schemepack, replace\nssc install scheme-burd, replace\nssc install colrspace, replace\nssc install palettes, replace\nssc install egenmore, replace\nssc install outreg2, replace\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: callout-note\nTo run do-files click the \"run-button\" or highlight the lines of code and hit ctrl + D (Windows) or shift + cmd + D (Mac)\n:::\n\nRunning the command should produce output in the console that looks like this:\n\n<blockquote>\n\n| **. ssc install geo2xy, replace**\n|   `checking geo2xy consistency and verifying not already installed...`\n|   `installing into c:\\ado\\plus\\... installation complete.`\n|   `...`\n\n</blockquote>\n\n::: callout-tip\n### Always comment your code\n\nCommenting your code is a good practice to get into. It helps you remember what you were doing when you come back to your code later, and it helps your partner understand what you are doing.\n\nIn Stata you can comment your code in one line\n\n`# like so`\n\nOr if you want to write a longer string\n\n`/*You can put your longer string of text inside a set of slashes and stars*/`\n\n![Try and make your comments more useful than these!](Lab-1-resources/commenting.PNG)\n\n:::\n\n#### Setting a directory\n\nIt is useful to put all of your work inside a specific file directory. This way, Stata knows where to look for your files and where to save output, like regression tables.\n\nThe path to my folder where I have the files for this lab is:\n\n`C:/Users/User/Documents/Recon/EOSE09/stata_files/`\n\nIf you have a Mac, it will look something like this:\n\n`Users/Jonathan/Documents/Stata-lab/`\n\nIf you want to change the settings on your Mac to display the file path in your **Finder** window, follow [this link](https://www.lifewire.com/use-macs-hidden-finder-path-bar-2260868).\n\nTo tell Stata that this is where I want it to look for my files, I'll use the `cd` (current directory) command in my do-file.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncd \"C:/Users/User/Documents/Recon/EOSE09/stata_files/\" # set your directory\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf successful, in the console I will see the following output:\n\n<blockquote>\n\n| **. `cd \"C:/Users/User/Documents/Recon/EOSE09/stata_files/\" # set your directory`**\n|   `C:\\Users\\User\\Documents\\Recon\\EOSE09\\stata_files`\n\n</blockquote>\n\nYou can call the help window by typing `help` into the console, and set your Stata version for compatability reasons with the `version` command, like so:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nhelp # Stata's help function; cf. also the web or Statalist\nversion 16.1 # version control\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Data types\n\nIn order to draw a map in Stata, we need to combine the information from our shapefile (which contains the geographic information such as the shape and location of the features on the map) with the information from our spreadsheet (which contains the data we want to display on the map, such as population or income).\n\nThe process of combining these two types of data is called \"joining\" or \"merging\" and it allows us to link the attributes from the spreadsheet to the geographic features in the shapefile. Without joining the data, we would only have the shape of the features on the map, but not the information we want to display.\n\nYou are likely familiar with the first type of data, it is a wide dataset in an excel spreadsheet.\n\nThe second is a `shapefile` - a file that stores the information a software program needs to draw a map.\n\n::: callout-note\n### Shapefiles üó∫Ô∏èüìäüíªüìÇ\n\nA shapefile is a type of data file that is used to store geographic information, such as the location of streets, buildings, and other features on a map. It is a common format used in geographic information systems (GIS) software.\n\nA shapefile consists of four components with different file extensions:\n\n-   .shp (shapefile): This file stores the actual geometric data for the features in the map, such as the shape of a street or a building.\n\n-   .shx (shape index): This file stores the index of the geometric data in the .shp file, which is used to quickly access the data in the correct order.\n\n-   .dbf (database file): This file stores the attribute data for the features in the map, such as the name of a street or the population of a building.\n\n-   .prj (projection file): This file stores information about the coordinate system and projection used for the data in the shapefile. This is important for ensuring that the map is displayed correctly and that measurements are accurate.\n\nTogether, these four files make up a complete shapefile and are necessary to properly display and analyze the geographic information.\n:::\n\n### Importing the Roses-Wolf dataset from Excel into Stata\n\nAt the moment, the database we want to use to draw our maps is in an excel sheet.\n\nIt has many tabs, and some lines are filled with headings before the data begins, as shown here:\n\n![Screenshot of excel file](Lab-1-resources/excel_format.PNG)\n\nWhat we want to do is import the data from each tab, and append it together.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nimport excel using RosesWolf_RegionalGDP_v6.xlsx, sheet(\"A1 Regional GDP\") firstrow cellrange(A6:O179) clear # import Excel sheet\n\nrename (D E F G H I J K L M N O) (year_1900 year_1910 year_1925 year_1938 year_1950 year_1960 year_1970 year_1980 year_1990 year_2000 year_2010 year_2015)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is what the data now looks like inside Stata. It is a wide dataframe, with 173 rows (the number of regions) and 15 variables (3 identifiers and 12 years worth of data)\n\n![Screenshot of Stata format](Lab-1-resources/stata_view_1.PNG)\n\n::: callout-tip\nRecall that the Roses Wolf database has geographic data on GDP and population at the nomenclature of territorial units 2 (NUTS-2) level, from 1900 to 2015.\n\nIf you want to have a look at this data in more detail, have a look at [this Shiny app](https://jonathan-jayes.shinyapps.io/Roses-Wolf-database-on-regional-GDP/).\n:::\n\nNext we want to be sure that Stata is reading in the values as numbers rather than text. For this we use the `destring` command.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nimport excel using RosesWolf_RegionalGDP_v6.xlsx, sheet(\"A1 Regional GDP\") firstrow cellrange(A6:O179) clear allstring `# we import each sheet in the Excel file separately and save it as one file`\n\nrename (D E F G H I J K L M N O) (year_1900 year_1910 year_1925 year_1938 year_1950 year_1960 year_1970 year_1980 year_1990 year_2000 year_2010 year_2015)\n    destring year_*, replace\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf there are non-numerical values in a string you cannot use destring and should not use the force-option as it would create missing values A better approach is to check all cases that are non-numerical and replace them (e.g. change \"one\" to \"1\")\n\nOther common data cleaning commands could include:\n\n`# tab var1 if missing(real(var1))` `# replace var1 ... if ...` `# destring var1, replace`\n\nNext we want to take the data from a wide format to a long format. A long format means that each row is an observation, each column is a variable, and each cell has just one value in it.\n\n![Reshape graphic](Lab-1-resources/wide_to_long.png)\n\nThe reshape command in Stata is used to change the shape of the data from one format to another. In this specific case, the reshape long option is used to change the data from a \"wide\" format to a \"long\" format.\n\nThe variables that come after \"year_\" are the variables that will be converted from wide to long format. In this case, \"year_\" is not a variable, it is a prefix of the variables that will be reshaped.\n\nThe option i(NUTSCodes Region Countrycurrentborder) specifies the identifier variables, which are variables that uniquely identify the observations in the dataset and will not be reshaped. In this case, \"NUTSCodes\", \"Region\", and \"Countrycurrentborder\" are the identifier variables.\n\nThe option j(year) specifies the variable that will be used as the new variable name for the reshaped variables. In this case, the new variable name will be \"year\" and it will be the identifier of the year of the data.\n\nWe save the data as a `.dta` file with the `save` command. The replace option overwrites any file with the same name in the directory.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nhelp reshape # Read up about the command here\nreshape long year_, i(NUTSCodes Region Countrycurrentborder) j(year)\nrename year_ regional_gdp_millions\nsave regional_gdp, replace \n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: callout-tip\nNever overwrite your raw data - this could be a big problem if you haven't saved it somewhere else. Good practice is to save a copy of your data in a different folder before the analysis, and make any changes through your do-file (e.g. changing \"one\" to \"1\" in Stata rather than excel).\n:::\n\nNow we can see the data in a long format if we use the browse (`br`) command:\n\n![](Lab-1-resources/regional_gdp.PNG)\n\nWe repeat this process for the remaining sheets in the Excel workbook.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nimport excel using RosesWolf_RegionalGDP_v6.xlsx, sheet(\"A1b Regional GDP (2011PPP)\") firstrow cellrange(A6:O179) clear allstring # repetition of the steps above for each sheet\nrename (D E F G H I J K L M N O) (year_1900 year_1910 year_1925 year_1938 year_1950 year_1960 year_1970 year_1980 year_1990 year_2000 year_2010 year_2015)\ndestring year_*, replace\nreshape long year_, i(NUTSCodes Region Countrycurrentborder) j(year)\nrename year_ regional_gdp_2011_ppp_millions\nsave regional_gdp_2011_ppp, replace\n...\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n### Importing the shapefiles into Stata\n\nDescribe importing a shapefile into Stata \n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nclear # clear the dataset in memory\n    \nshp2dta using regions_nuts2, database(regions) coordinates(nutscoord) genid(_ID) replace\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \nNow we have a little data cleaning to do:\nThere are three particular regions that need to be joined together in the Roses-Wolf database in order to be plotted correctly. If we don't correct these, there will be holes in our map, as shown below:\n\n![Screenshot from [my Shiny app](https://jonathan-jayes.shinyapps.io/Roses-Wolf-database-on-regional-GDP/)](Lab-1-resources/hole_in_map.PNG)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nuse regions, clear # fixing the identifier of the NUTS_Codes so that the merge below works for all regions in the dataset\nreplace NUTS_CODE = \"AT12+AT13\" if NUTS_CODE == \"AT123\"\nreplace NUTS_CODE = \"DE71+DE72\" if NUTS_CODE == \"DE712\"\nreplace NUTS_CODE = \"DE91+DE92\" if NUTS_CODE == \"DE912\"\nsave regions, replace\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n#### Projections\n\nMap projections are methods used to represent the surface of the Earth on a flat map. Different projections have different properties, such as preserving area, shape, or direction, and each has its own set of distortions. The Mercator projection is a cylindrical projection that was developed in the 16th century for navigation. It is particularly useful for representing the entire globe at once, but it distorts the size and shape of landmasses near the poles. \n\n::: callout-note\n### Mercator popularity\n\nWeb Mercator, also known as Google Web Mercator, Spherical Mercator, WGS 84 Web Mercator or WGS 84/Pseudo-Mercator, is a variant of the Mercator projection that is optimized for use on the web. It is the projection used by Google Maps, OpenStreetMap, and many other online mapping services.\n\n![Obligatory [XKCD comic](https://xkcd.com/977/)](Lab-1-resources/projections.png)\n\nHave a look at [this link](https://www.statalist.org/forums/forum/general-stata-discussion/general/1306288-legend-in-spmap) to the Stata forum that explains different projections.\n:::\n\nWe will use the Albers projection, which is saved as `nutscoord.dta` in your working directory.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nuse nutscoord, clear # we use the Albers projection; every projection looks a bit different\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet's give a gander what the projection looks using the `scatter` command.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nscatter _Y _X\nscatter _Y _X, msize(tiny) msymbol(point)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {#fig-scatter layout-ncol=2}\n\n![Scatter with no options](Lab-1-resources/scatter_no_opts.png){#fig-no-opts}\n\n![Scatter specifying msize and msymbol](Lab-1-resources/scatter_with_opts.png){#fig-opts}\n\nComparison of scatter plots\n:::\n\n::: callout-tip\n### Scatter options\n\nThe msize() option in the scatter command is used to set the size of the markers in the graph. The markers can be circles, squares, or other shapes, and the size option controls their overall size. The value of the option can be a number, which represents the size in units of the graph, or a variable name, which represents the size relative to the values of that variable.\n\nThe msymbol() option in the scatter command is used to set the shape of the markers in the graph. The markers can be circles, squares, or other shapes, and the msymbol option controls their shape. The value of the option can be a number, which represents the shape, or a variable name, which represents the shape relative to the values of that variable.\n:::\n\nYou can experiment with other projections, have a look at the `geo2xy` help file:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nhelp geo2xy\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n![Stata's projections](Lab-1-resources/stata_projections.PNG)\n\n### Merge shapefiles and data together\n\nWe're nearly there! Now we have both file types in the correct format in Stata. All that is left to do is merge them together so that we can plot maps with the Roses-Wolf data.\n\nWe start by importing our clean, long format data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nuse regional_gdp, clear # we merge all created files together\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe are going to use the `merge` command. Read more about it by typing `help merge` into the console.\n\n![Merge explained](Lab-1-resources/merge_stata.PNG)\n\n::: callout-tip\n### Merge types\n\n1:1 matches occur when each observation in one dataset has a unique match in the other dataset, based on the specified variable(s). This is the most common type of match and is the default behavior of the merge command.\n\n1:m matches occur when one observation in one dataset has multiple matches in the other dataset, based on the specified variable(s). This can happen when there are duplicate values in the specified variable(s) in one of the datasets.\n\nm:m matches occur when multiple observations in one dataset have multiple matches in the other dataset, based on the specified variable(s).

Each format code has a combination of width, decimal places and data type specifiers to format the numbers as desired.\n\n:::\n\nThat's better!\n\n![](Lab-1-resources/spmap_6.PNG)\n\n### Change legend breaks and add a title\n\nLet's make the numbers in the legend more logical:\n\n::: callout-tip\n\nIn Stata, the `clmethod()` command is used to specify the method for creating breaks (or intervals) on a color scale in a graph. The `clbreaks()` command is used to specify the values of the breaks.\n\nIn this specific example, the command \"clmethod(custom) clbreaks(0 (1000) 12000)\" is used to create a custom color scale with the following properties:\n\n- The scale starts at 0.\n- The gradations of the scale are 1,000.\n- The top end of the scale is 12,000.\n\nThe `clbreaks()` command is set to \"0 (1000) 12000\" which means that the color scale starts at 0 and continues to increase in increments of 1,000 up to 12,000. In other words, the scale will have 12 breaks or intervals: 0, 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000, 5000, 6000, 7000, 8000, 9000, 10000, 11000, 12000.\n\nThis custom scale will be used to colour the data points in the graph accordingly.\n\nIt's important to note that the command \"clmethod(custom)\" is required to use the custom breaks defined in the \"clbreaks()\" command.\n\n:::\n\nThe number of breaks is a stylistic choice and can impact the message that the reader takes away. Consider how the dark blue areas stand out in Sweden and the UK in the second figure, compared to the first.\n\n(I think you see by now what the graph editor looks like - I'm saving the image from the editor from now on.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nspmap regional_gdp_cap_1990 using \"nutscoord.dta\" if year == 1950, id(_ID) fcolor(Blues2) legend(pos(9)) legstyle(2) ///\n\ttitle(\"Regional GDP per Capita - 1950 \", size(medium)) ///\n\tosize(0.02 ..) ocolor(gs8 ..) ///\n\tclmethod(custom) clbreaks(0 (1000) 12000)\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nspmap regional_gdp_cap_1990 using \"nutscoord.dta\" if year == 1950, id(_ID) fcolor(Blues2) legend(pos(9)) legstyle(1) ///\n\ttitle(\"Regional GDP per Capita - 1950\", size(medium)) ///\n\tosize(0.02 ..) ocolor(white ..) ///\n\tclmethod(custom) clbreaks(0 3000 (1000) 6000 12000)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {layout-ncol=2 .column-page}\n\n\n![Lots of breaks](Lab-1-resources/spmap_7.PNG)\n\n\n\n![Fewer breaks](Lab-1-resources/spmap_8.PNG)\n\nComparison of breaks\n:::\n\n### What do we do about the areas with no data?\n\nLet's have a look at the employment share in industry.\n\nLook at the North of the UK in 1950 - such a powerhouse!\n\n::: callout-tip\nThe `ndfcolor(gray)` command makes areas with no data greyed out (note the US spelling of gray vs grey)\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nspmap employment_share_industry using \"nutscoord.dta\" if year == 1950, id(_ID) fcolor(Blues2) legend(pos(9)) legstyle(2) ///\n\ttitle(\"Employment Share Industry - 1950\", size(medium)) ///\n\tosize(0.02 ..) ocolor(white ..) ///\n\tndfcolor(gray) ndocolor(none ..) ndsize(0.02 ..)\n\nspmap employment_share_industry using \"nutscoord.dta\" if year == 1950, id(_ID) fcolor(Blues2) legend(pos(9)) legstyle(2) ///\n\ttitle(\"Employment Share Industry - 1950\", size(medium)) ///\n\tosize(0.02 ..) ocolor(white ..) ///\n\tclmethod(custom) clbreaks(0 (0.2) 0.8) ///\n\tndfcolor(gray) ndocolor(none ..) ndsize(0.02 ..)\n\t\nspmap employment_share_industry using \"nutscoord.dta\" if year == 1950, id(_ID) fcolor(Blues2) legstyle(2) ///\n\ttitle(\"Employment Share Industry - 1950\", size(large)) ///\n\tosize(0.02 ..) ocolor(white ..) ///\n\tclmethod(custom) clbreaks(0 (0.2) 0.8) ///\n\tlegend(pos(9) size(medium) rowgap(1.5) label(5 \"60-80 %\") label(4 \"40-60 %\") ///\n\tlabel(3 \"20-40 %\") label(2 \"0-20 %\") label(1 \"No data\")) ///\n\tndfcolor(gray) ndocolor(white ..) ndsize(0.02 ..)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {layout-ncol=3 .column-page}\n\n![Default legend](Lab-1-resources/spmap_9.PNG)\n\n![Breaks by 20 percent](Lab-1-resources/spmap_10.PNG)\n\n![A well formatted legend](Lab-1-resources/spmap_11.PNG)\n\nMore legend comparisons\n\n:::\n",
