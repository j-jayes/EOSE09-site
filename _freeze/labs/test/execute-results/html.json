Installing basic packages: We will go over how to install the necessary packages in order to run our analysis. This will include packages such as \"spmap\" and \"geo2xy\" which will allow us to create maps in Stata.\n\n2.  Data types: We will discuss the different types of data that we will be working with in this lab. Specifically, we will be using time series data from a spreadsheet and map data from a shapefile. It is important to understand the structure and format of these data types in order to properly analyze and visualize them.\n\n3.  Basic mapping: Once we have our data, we will learn how to draw a basic map using the \"maps\" and \"maptools\" packages. We will go over how to import the shapefile data, how to define the map scale, and how to add different layers to the map such as points, lines, and polygons.\n\nBy the end of this lab, you should have a solid understanding of how to install necessary packages, how to work with different types of data, and how to draw a basic map in Stata.\n\n📊🗺️💻 Let's get started!\n\n## Getting started\n\nGiven that you have encountered Stata previously in your studies, I will not spend undue time explaining the basics. If you want to brush up on Stata's syntax, I reccomend having a look at [these slides](https://github.com/j-jayes/EOSE09/blob/b8444dd95783f4434ab63c4ad28b0f3033d4fd0a/resources/StataTutorial.pdf) from Oscar Torres-Reyna, or [this set of Youtube videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXsPgQe-aqs&ab_channel=SebastianWaiEcon) From Sebastian Wai.\n\n### Install additional programs and set-up\n\nFirst we need to install the packages in Stata that we will make use of. Please do this before our lab session in order to save time.\n\nWe use the `ssc install` command, as follows:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nssc install spmap, replace\nssc install geo2xy, replace\nssc install shp2dta, replace\nssc install schemepack, replace\nssc install scheme-burd, replace\nssc install colrspace, replace\nssc install palettes, replace\nssc install egenmore, replace\nssc install outreg2, replace\n```\n:::\n\n\n::: callout-note\nTo run do-files click the \"run-button\" or highlight the lines of code and hit ctrl + D (Windows) or shift + cmd + D (Mac)\n:::\n\nRunning the command should produce output in the console that looks like this:\n\n<blockquote>\n\n| **. ssc install geo2xy, replace**\n|   `checking geo2xy consistency and verifying not already installed...`\n|   `installing into c:\\ado\\plus\\... installation complete.`\n|   `...`\n\n</blockquote>",
