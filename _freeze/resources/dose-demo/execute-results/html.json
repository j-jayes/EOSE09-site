It covers all of Europe. \n\nIn your project, you may want to add some colour to your story by comparing the economic development of your country to other countries outside of the dataset, be it in the Americas or Asia. \n\nThe [DOSE â€“ Global data set of reported sub-national economic output](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-023-02323-8#Abs1) dataset is a great resource for this. It contains data on regional economic development for 83 countries in the world, at varying times from 1960 to today.\n\nI have formatted it into Stata format and saved a shapefile that you can use to create maps to supplement your analysis, if you wish.\n\nYou can download the Stata data file [here](assets/DOSE_V2_with_id_from_stata.dta)\n\nYou can download the coordinates file [here](assets/DOSE_V2_coords.dta)\n\nYou can download a dofile to create maps [here](assets/DOSE_V2_map_file.do)\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n### Variables\n\nThere are several variables in the dataset. Here are the labels for each of them, as you can use in Stata.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlabel variable country \"Full-length country name\"\nlabel variable GID_0 \"3-digits ISO-Code\"\nlabel variable region \"Primary region name\"\nlabel variable GID_1 \"GADM-identifier for level-1 administrative unit, or customly created identifier\"\nlabel variable year \"Calendar year\"\nlabel variable grp_lcu \"Gross regional product in local currency and current prices\"\nlabel variable pop \"Regional population estimate\"\nlabel variable grp_pc_lcu \"Gross regional product per capita in local currency and current prices\"\nlabel variable grp_pc_usd \"Gross regional product per capita in US dollar and current prices\"\nlabel variable grp_pc_lcu_2015 \"Gross regional product per capita in local currency and 2015 prices\"\nlabel variable grp_pc_usd_2015 \"Gross regional product per capita in US dollar and US 2015 prices\"\nlabel variable grp_pc_lcu2015_usd \"Gross regional product per capita in local 2015 prices and converted to US dollar using the 2015 exchange rate\"\nlabel variable cpi_2015 \"Worldbank Consumer Price Index with base year 2015\"\nlabel variable deflator_2015 \"Worldbank national GDP deflator with base year 2015\"\nlabel variable fx \"FRED market exchange rate (local currency to one USD)\"\nlabel variable PPP \"Purchasing Power Parity exchange rate (local currency to one international dollar)\"\nlabel variable StructChange \"Categorical variable indicating the start of a new data source, changes in administrative boundaries, and when regional time series were extended to a previous version of DOSE\"\nlabel variable T_a \"Area-weighted annual mean temperature\"\nlabel variable P_a \"Area-weighted annual total precipitation\"\n```\n:::\n\n\n### Data coverage\n\nNot every country has data for every year. Here is a plot showing the data coverage for a selection of half of the countries in the dataset.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](dose-demo_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Example: GDP per capita\n\nWe might want to plot the evolution of gross regional product per capita in South African and Mozambique to contrast with Sweden and Finland. \n\nWe want to know what the names of the regions are first:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nReading layer `dose_v2_map_file' from data source \n  `/Users/jonathanjayes/Documents/PhD/EOSE09-site/data/dose_v2_map_file.shp' \n  using driver `ESRI Shapefile'\nSimple feature collection with 1602 features and 11 fields\nGeometry type: MULTIPOLYGON\nDimension:     XY\nBounding box:  xmin: -179.9984 ymin: -55.9797 xmax: 179.9979 ymax: 83.11042\nGeodetic CRS:  WGS 84\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](dose-demo_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNext we can create a facet plot and fill the polygons with the GRP per capita in 2000, 2004, 2008, 2012, and 2016.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](dose-demo_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::",
