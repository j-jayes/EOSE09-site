    "text": "Getting started\nGiven that you have encountered Stata previously in your studies, I will not spend undue time explaining the basics. If you want to brush up on Stata’s syntax, I reccomend having a look at these slides from Oscar Torres-Reyna, or this set of Youtube videos From Sebastian Wai.\n\nInstall additional programs and set-up\nFirst we need to install the packages in Stata that we will make use of. Please do this before our lab session in order to save time.\nWe use the ssc install command, as follows:\nssc install spmap, replace\nssc install geo2xy, replace\nssc install shp2dta, replace\nssc install schemepack, replace\nssc install scheme-burd, replace\nssc install colrspace, replace\nssc install palettes, replace\nssc install egenmore, replace\nssc install outreg2, replace\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nTo run do-files click the “run-button” or highlight the lines of code and hit ctrl + D (Windows) or shift + cmd + D (Mac)\n\n\nRunning the command should produce output in the console that looks like this:\n\n. ssc install geo2xy, replace\n  checking geo2xy consistency and verifying not already installed...\n  installing into c:\\ado\\plus\\... installation complete.\n  ...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nalways comment your code\n\n\n\nIn Stata you can comment your code in one line\n// like so\nOr if you want to write a longer string\n/*You can put your longer string of text inside a set of slashes and stars*/\n\n\n\nSetting a directory\nIt is useful to put all of your work inside a specific file directory. This way, Stata knows where to look for your files and where to save output, like regression tables.\nThe path to my folder where I have the files for this lab is:\nC:/Users/User/Documents/Recon/EOSE09/stata_files/\nIf you have a Mac, it will look something like this:\nUsers/Jonathan/Documents/Stata-lab/\nIf you want to change the settings on your Mac to display the file path in your Finder window, follow this link.\nTo tell Stata that this is where I want it to look for my files, I’ll use the cd (current directory) command in my do-file.\ncd \"C:/Users/User/Documents/Recon/EOSE09/stata_files/\" // set your directory\nIf successful, in the console I will see the following output:\n\n. cd \"C:/Users/User/Documents/Recon/EOSE09/stata_files/\" // set your directory\n  C:\\Users\\User\\Documents\\Recon\\EOSE09\\stata_files\n\nYou can call the help window by typing help into the console, and set your Stata version for compatability reasons with the version command, like so:\nhelp // Stata's help function; cf. also the web or Statalist\nversion 16.1 // version control"

    "text": "Importing the Roses-Wolf dataset from Excel into Stata\nAt the moment, the database we want to use to draw our maps is in an excel sheet.\nIt has many tabs, and some lines are filled with headings before the data begins, as show here:\n\n\n\nScreenshot of excel file\n\n\nWhat we want to do is import the data from each tab, and append it together.\nimport excel using RosesWolf_RegionalGDP_v6.xlsx, sheet(\"A1 Regional GDP\") firstrow cellrange(A6:O179) clear // import Excel sheet\nrename (D E F G H I J K L M N O) (year_1900 year_1910 year_1925 year_1938 year_1950 year_1960 year_1970 year_1980 year_1990 year_2000 year_2010 year_2015)\nThis is what the data now looks like inside Stata. It is a wide dataframe, with 173 rows (the number of regions) and 15 variables (3 identifiers and 12 years worth of data)\n\n\n\nScreenshot of Stata format\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nRecall that the Roses Wolf database has geographic data on GDP and population at the nomenclature of territorial units 2 (NUTS-2) level, from 1900 to 2015.\n\n\nNext we want to be sure that Stata is reading in the values as numbers rather than text. For this we use the destring command.\nimport excel using RosesWolf_RegionalGDP_v6.xlsx, sheet(\"A1 Regional GDP\") firstrow cellrange(A6:O179) clear allstring `// we import each sheet in the Excel file separately and save it as one file`\nrename (D E F G H I J K L M N O) (year_1900 year_1910 year_1925 year_1938 year_1950 year_1960 year_1970 year_1980 year_1990 year_2000 year_2010 year_2015)\ndestring year_*, replace\nIf there are non-numerical values in a string you cannot use destring and should not use the force-option as it would create missing values A better approach is to check all cases that are non-numerical and replace them (e.g. change “one” to “1”)\nOther common data cleaning commands could include:\n// tab var1 if missing(real(var1)) // replace var1 ... if ... // destring var1, replace\nNext we want to take the data from a wide format to a long format. A long format means that each row is an observation, each column is a variable, and each cell has just one value in it.\n\n\n\nReshape graphic\n\n\nhelp reshape\nreshape long year_, i(NUTSCodes Region Countrycurrentborder) j(year)\nrename year_ regional_gdp_millions\nsave regional_gdp, replace \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nNever overwrite your raw data - this could be a big problem if you haven’t saved it somewhere else. Good practice is to save a copy of your data in a different folder before the analysis, and make any changes through your do-file (e.g. changing “one” to “1” in Stata rather than excel)."
