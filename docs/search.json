    "text": "Getting started\nGiven that you have encountered Stata previously in your studies, I will not spend undue time explaining the basics. If you want to brush up on Stata‚Äôs syntax, I recommend having a look at these slides from Oscar Torres-Reyna, or this set of Youtube videos From Sebastian Wai. I‚Äôve put together a comprehensive set of resources on this page here.\n\nInstall additional programs and set-up\nFirst we need to install the packages in Stata that we will make use of. Please do this before our lab session in order to save time.\nWe use the ssc install command, as follows:\n\nssc install spmap, replace\nssc install geo2xy, replace\nssc install shp2dta, replace\nssc install schemepack, replace\nssc install scheme-burd, replace\nssc install colrspace, replace\nssc install palettes, replace\nssc install egenmore, replace\nssc install outreg2, replace\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nTo run do-files click the ‚Äúrun-button‚Äù or highlight the lines of code and hit ctrl + D (Windows) or shift + cmd + D (Mac)\n\n\nRunning the command should produce output in the console that looks like this:\n\n. ssc install geo2xy, replace\n¬†¬†checking geo2xy consistency and verifying not already installed...\n¬†¬†installing into c:\\ado\\plus\\... installation complete.\n¬†¬†...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlways comment your code\n\n\n\nIn Stata you can comment your code in one line\n# like so\nOr if you want to write a longer string\n/*You can put your longer string of text inside a set of slashes and stars*/\n\n\n\nSetting a directory\nIt is useful to put all of your work inside a specific file directory. This way, Stata knows where to look for your files and where to save output, like regression tables.\nThe path to my folder where I have the files for this lab is:\nC:/Users/User/Documents/Recon/EOSE09/stata_files/\nIf you have a Mac, it will look something like this:\nUsers/Jonathan/Documents/Stata-lab/\nIf you want to change the settings on your Mac to display the file path in your Finder window, follow this link.\nTo tell Stata that this is where I want it to look for my files, I‚Äôll use the cd (current directory) command in my do-file.\n\ncd \"C:/Users/User/Documents/Recon/EOSE09/stata_files/\" # set your directory\n\nIf successful, in the console I will see the following output:\n\n. cd \"C:/Users/User/Documents/Recon/EOSE09/stata_files/\" # set your directory\n¬†¬†C:\\Users\\User\\Documents\\Recon\\EOSE09\\stata_files\n\nYou can call the help window by typing help into the console, and set your Stata version for compatability reasons with the version command, like so:\n\nhelp # Stata's help function; cf. also the web or Statalist\nversion 16.1 # version control"

    "title": "Stata Lab 1 Mapping Growth: Basic Maps",
    "section": "Data types",
    "text": "Data types\nIn order to draw a map in Stata, we need to combine the information from our shapefile (which contains the geographic information such as the shape and location of the features on the map) with the information from our spreadsheet (which contains the data we want to display on the map, such as population or income).\nThe process of combining these two types of data is called ‚Äújoining‚Äù or ‚Äúmerging‚Äù and it allows us to link the attributes from the spreadsheet to the geographic features in the shapefile. Without joining the data, we would only have the shape of the features on the map, but not the information we want to display.\nYou are likely familiar with the first type of data, it is a wide dataset in an excel spreadsheet.\nThe second is a shapefile - a file that stores the information a software program needs to draw a map.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShapefiles üó∫Ô∏èüìäüíªüìÇ\n\n\n\nA shapefile is a type of data file that is used to store geographic information, such as the location of streets, buildings, and other features on a map. It is a common format used in geographic information systems (GIS) software.\nA shapefile consists of four components with different file extensions:\n\n.shp (shapefile): This file stores the actual geometric data for the features in the map, such as the shape of a street or a building.\n.shx (shape index): This file stores the index of the geometric data in the .shp file, which is used to quickly access the data in the correct order.\n.dbf (database file): This file stores the attribute data for the features in the map, such as the name of a street or the population of a building.\n.prj (projection file): This file stores information about the coordinate system and projection used for the data in the shapefile. This is important for ensuring that the map is displayed correctly and that measurements are accurate.\n\nTogether, these four files make up a complete shapefile and are necessary to properly display and analyze the geographic information.\n\n\n\nImporting the Roses-Wolf dataset from Excel into Stata\nAt the moment, the database we want to use to draw our maps is in an excel sheet.\nIt has many tabs, and some lines are filled with headings before the data begins, as shown here:\n\n\n\nScreenshot of excel file\n\n\nWhat we want to do is import the data from each tab, and append it together.\n\nimport excel using RosesWolf_RegionalGDP_v6.xlsx, sheet(\"A1 Regional GDP\") firstrow cellrange(A6:O179) clear # import Excel sheet\n\nrename (D E F G H I J K L M N O) (year_1900 year_1910 year_1925 year_1938 year_1950 year_1960 year_1970 year_1980 year_1990 year_2000 year_2010 year_2015)\n\nThis is what the data now looks like inside Stata. It is a wide dataframe, with 173 rows (the number of regions) and 15 variables (3 identifiers and 12 years worth of data)\n\n\n\nScreenshot of Stata format\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nRecall that the Roses Wolf database has geographic data on GDP and population at the nomenclature of territorial units 2 (NUTS-2) level, from 1900 to 2015.\nIf you want to have a look at this data in more detail, have a look at this Shiny app.\n\n\nNext we want to be sure that Stata is reading in the values as numbers rather than text. For this we use the destring command.\n\nimport excel using RosesWolf_RegionalGDP_v6.xlsx, sheet(\"A1 Regional GDP\") firstrow cellrange(A6:O179) clear allstring `# we import each sheet in the Excel file separately and save it as one file`\n\nrename (D E F G H I J K L M N O) (year_1900 year_1910 year_1925 year_1938 year_1950 year_1960 year_1970 year_1980 year_1990 year_2000 year_2010 year_2015)\n    destring year_*, replace\n\nIf there are non-numerical values in a string you cannot use destring and should not use the force-option as it would create missing values A better approach is to check all cases that are non-numerical and replace them (e.g.¬†change ‚Äúone‚Äù to ‚Äú1‚Äù)\nOther common data cleaning commands could include:\n# tab var1 if missing(real(var1)) # replace var1 ... if ... # destring var1, replace\nNext we want to take the data from a wide format to a long format. A long format means that each row is an observation, each column is a variable, and each cell has just one value in it.\n\n\n\nReshape graphic\n\n\nThe reshape command in Stata is used to change the shape of the data from one format to another. In this specific case, the reshape long option is used to change the data from a ‚Äúwide‚Äù format to a ‚Äúlong‚Äù format.\nThe variables that come after ‚Äúyear_‚Äù are the variables that will be converted from wide to long format. In this case, ‚Äúyear_‚Äù is not a variable, it is a prefix of the variables that will be reshaped.\nThe option i(NUTSCodes Region Countrycurrentborder) specifies the identifier variables, which are variables that uniquely identify the observations in the dataset and will not be reshaped. In this case, ‚ÄúNUTSCodes‚Äù, ‚ÄúRegion‚Äù, and ‚ÄúCountrycurrentborder‚Äù are the identifier variables.\nThe option j(year) specifies the variable that will be used as the new variable name for the reshaped variables. In this case, the new variable name will be ‚Äúyear‚Äù and it will be the identifier of the year of the data.\nWe save the data as a .dta file with the save command.

Different projections have different properties, such as preserving area, shape, or direction, and each has its own set of distortions. The Mercator projection is a cylindrical projection that was developed in the 16th century for navigation. It is particularly useful for representing the entire globe at once, but it distorts the size and shape of landmasses near the poles.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMercator popularity\n\n\n\nWeb Mercator, also known as Google Web Mercator, Spherical Mercator, WGS 84 Web Mercator or WGS 84/Pseudo-Mercator, is a variant of the Mercator projection that is optimized for use on the web. It is the projection used by Google Maps, OpenStreetMap, and many other online mapping services.\n\n\n\nObligatory XKCD comic\n\n\nHave a look at this link to the Stata forum that explains different projections.\n\n\nWe will use the Albers projection, which is saved as nutscoord.dta in your working directory.\n\nuse nutscoord, clear # we use the Albers projection; every projection looks a bit different\n\nLet‚Äôs give a gander what the projection looks using the scatter command.\n\nscatter _Y _X\nscatter _Y _X, msize(tiny) msymbol(point)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Scatter with no options\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Scatter specifying msize and msymbol\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†1: Comparison of scatter plots\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScatter options\n\n\n\nThe msize() option in the scatter command is used to set the size of the markers in the graph. The markers can be circles, squares, or other shapes, and the size option controls their overall size. The value of the option can be a number, which represents the size in units of the graph, or a variable name, which represents the size relative to the values of that variable.\nThe msymbol() option in the scatter command is used to set the shape of the markers in the graph. The markers can be circles, squares, or other shapes, and the msymbol option controls their shape. The value of the option can be a number, which represents the shape, or a variable name, which represents the shape relative to the values of that variable.\n\n\nYou can experiment with other projections, have a look at the geo2xy help file:\n\nhelp geo2xy\n\n\n\n\nStata‚Äôs projections\n\n\n\n\n\nMerge shapefiles and data together\nWe‚Äôre nearly there! Now we have both file types in the correct format in Stata. All that is left to do is merge them together so that we can plot maps with the Roses-Wolf data.\nWe start by importing our clean, long format data.\n\nuse regional_gdp, clear # we merge all created files together\n\nWe are going to use the merge command. Read more about it by typing help merge into the console.\n\n\n\nMerge explained\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMerge types\n\n\n\n1:1 matches occur when each observation in one dataset has a unique match in the other dataset, based on the specified variable(s). This is the most common type of match and is the default behavior of the merge command.\n1:m matches occur when one observation in one dataset has multiple matches in the other dataset, based on the specified variable(s). This can happen when there are duplicate values in the specified variable(s) in one of the datasets.\nm:m matches occur when multiple observations in one dataset have multiple matches in the other dataset, based on the specified variable(s). This is the least common type of match, as it requires duplicate values in the specified variable(s) in both datasets.\n\n\n\nmerge 1:1 NUTSCodes year using regional_gdp_2011_ppp # this is a 1:1 merge\ndrop _merge\n\nYou should get output that looks like so:\n\n. merge 1:1 NUTSCodes year using regional_gdp_2011_ppp # this is a 1:1 merge\n¬†¬†¬†Result # of obs.\n¬†¬†¬†‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äì\n¬†¬†¬†not matched 0\n¬†¬†¬†matched 2,076 (_merge==3)\n¬†¬†¬†‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äì\n\nWe now repeat the process for all of our variables in the Roses-Wolf database.\n\nmerge 1:1 NUTSCodes year using population, assert(match) nogen\nmerge 1:1 NUTSCodes year using share_agriculture, assert(match) nogen\nmerge 1:1 NUTSCodes year using share_industry, assert(match) nogen\nmerge 1:1 NUTSCodes year using share_services, assert(match) nogen\n\nNow we add in area to all of the variables with an m:1 merge\n\nmerge m:1 NUTSCodes using area_km2, assert(match) nogen # this is a m:1 merge; there is also a 1:m merges; m:m merges are a bad idea\n\nLet‚Äôs fix our nomenclature\n\nrename NUTSCodes NUTS_CODE\nmerge m:1 NUTS_CODE using regions\n\nLet‚Äôd now drop all of the regions for which there is map information, but no data from the Roses-Wolf database.\n\ndrop if _merge == 2 # we keep all regions that are merged and delete those for which we have geographical information but no data\ndrop _merge\norder _ID, after(NUTS_CODE)\n\nWonderful!

The clbreaks() command is used to specify the values of the breaks.\nIn this specific example, the command ‚Äúclmethod(custom) clbreaks(0 (1000) 12000)‚Äù is used to create a custom color scale with the following properties:\n\nThe scale starts at 0.\nThe gradations of the scale are 1,000.\nThe top end of the scale is 12,000.\n\nThe clbreaks() command is set to ‚Äú0 (1000) 12000‚Äù which means that the color scale starts at 0 and continues to increase in increments of 1,000 up to 12,000. In other words, the scale will have 12 breaks or intervals: 0, 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000, 5000, 6000, 7000, 8000, 9000, 10000, 11000, 12000.\nThis custom scale will be used to colour the data points in the graph accordingly.\nIt‚Äôs important to note that the command ‚Äúclmethod(custom)‚Äù is required to use the custom breaks defined in the ‚Äúclbreaks()‚Äù command.\n\n\nThe number of breaks is a stylistic choice and can impact the message that the reader takes away.

Because clmethod(quantile) is actually the default classification method, we don‚Äôt need to specify it in our command.\n\nspmap regional_gdp_cap_1990 using \"nutscoord.dta\" if year == 1950, id(_ID) fcolor(Blues2) legend(pos(9)) legstyle(2) \n    title(\"Regional GDP per Capita - 1950\", size(medium)) \n    osize(0.02 ..) ocolor(white ..)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen we do this for two maps showing the same variable in two time periods, we can use quantile breaks to highlight the change between the periods - which regions have seen growth and which have dallied behind.\nIn the code below, we produce two maps with Stata‚Äôs default four bins based on the distribution of regional GDP per capita and compare them.\n\nspmap regional_gdp_cap_1990 using \"nutscoord.dta\" if year == 1950, id(_ID) fcolor(YlGnBu) legend(pos(9)) legstyle(2) \n    title(\"Regional GDP per Capita - 1950\", size(medium)) \n    osize(0.02 ..) ocolor(white ..) \n    clmethod(quantile) name(graph_1950, replace)\n    \nspmap regional_gdp_cap_1990 using \"nutscoord.dta\" if year == 2010, id(_ID) fcolor(YlGnBu) legend(pos(9)) legstyle(2) \n    title(\"Regional GDP per Capita - 2010\", size(medium)) \n    osize(0.02 ..) ocolor(white ..) \n    clmethod(quantile) name(graph_2010, replace)\n\ngraph combine graph_1950 graph_2010\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecifying quantile breaks\nWe can also increase the number of breaks by specifying the method and number of breaks: clmethod(quantile) clnumber(8).\n\nspmap regional_gdp_cap_1990 using \"nutscoord.dta\" if year == 1950, id(_ID) fcolor(YlOrRd) legend(pos(9)) legstyle(2) \n    title(\"Regional GDP per Capita - 1950\", size(medium)) \n    osize(0.02 ..) ocolor(white ..) \n    clmethod(quantile) clnumber(8)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFurther, we can specify the exact breaks - in this case showing the regional GDP per capita relative to the average for the countries in our dataset.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nYou can compare with maps 2.4a and 2.4b in the course book.\n\n\n\nspmap relative_gdp_cap_eu using \"nutscoord.dta\" if year == 1900, id(_ID) fcolor(YlOrRd) legend(pos(9)) legstyle(2) \n    osize(0.02 ..) ocolor(white ..) title(1900) \n    clmethod(custom) clbreaks(0 0.8 1 1.2 3) \n    name(graph_1900, replace)\n\nspmap relative_gdp_cap_eu using \"nutscoord.dta\" if year == 2010, id(_ID) fcolor(YlOrRd) legend(pos(9)) legstyle(2) \n    osize(0.02 ..) ocolor(white ..) title(2010) \n    clmethod(custom) clbreaks(0 0.8 1 1.2 3) \n    name(graph_2010, replace)\n\ngraph combine graph_1900 graph_2010\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelative regional GDP per capita"

    "section": "Globals and locals",
    "text": "Globals and locals\n\nWhy use them?\nIn Stata, locals and globals are used to create and store values that can be reused in different parts of the program.\nlocals are temporary variables that are only stored in memory while the program or do-file is running. They can be used to define values that are specific to a certain block of code or section of the program. Once the program or do-file is finished running, the locals are deleted from memory.\nglobals, on the other hand, are stored in memory until you exit Stata, and can be accessed from any part of the program or do-file. They can be used to define values that need to persist throughout the entire analysis or across different datasets.\nThese macros are useful to shorten code and to iterate through a loop multiple times.\n\n\nHow to use them\nIn the code below we make use of locals twice:\n\nforeach var of varlist employment_share_industry employment_share_services {\n    foreach i of numlist 1950 (10) 1970 {\n        spmap `var' using \"nutscoord.dta\" if year == `i', id(_ID)\n    }\n}\n\nThis Stata code creates a series of maps using the spmap command.\nThe foreach loop iterates over two variables, employment_share_industry and employment_share_services. For each of these variables, the loop creates a map for three years between 1950 and 1970. Specifically, it creates maps for the years 1950, 1960, and 1970, using a step size of 10.\nThe spmap command is used to create the maps. The first argument of spmap is the variable to be mapped, which is specified using the varlist option and the local macro var. The second argument is the data file containing the spatial coordinates of the regions, specified as ‚Äúnutscoord.dta‚Äù. The third argument specifies the condition for which the map is created, in this case year == `i', which ensures that only the observations corresponding to the current year of the loop are included. The id(_ID) option tells spmap to use the _ID variable in the dataset as the unique identifier for the regions being mapped.\n\n\nExample of an output\nHere we make a global macro with a variable list of two variables.\nThen we loop through the list of variables to make a map for each, and name the map with the variable and the year. Finally we combine them in a single image.\n\nglobal varlist employment_share_industry employment_share_services\n\nforeach var of varlist $varlist {\n    foreach i of numlist 1950 (10) 1970 {\n        spmap `var' using \"nutscoord.dta\" if year == `i', id(_ID) name(`var'_`i', replace)\n    }\n}\n\n\ngraph combine employment_share_industry_1960 employment_share_industry_1970 employment_share_industry_1980 employment_share_industry_1990\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample of graph combine used in conjunction with global and local macros\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMacros treat strings and numbers differently\nStrings need quotes and displaying them works just like other locals.\n\nlocal a \"Hello\"\nlocal b \"World\"\ndi \"`a' `b'\"\n\nHello World\nNumbers don‚Äôt need quotes and you can operate on them with operators, for example, the plus opertor.\n\nlocal x = 1\nlocal y = 2\ndi `x' + `y'\n\n3"

    "text": "Choose specific colours for choropleth\nQ: Could you help me with the code and command I need to use in Stata to change the color of a specific region in a choropleth map?\nA: Sure! We can choose our own colours for a palette with their RGB codes\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRGB colour codes\n\n\n\nWhat are RGB Color Codes?\nRGB color codes are a set of numerical values used to specify colors in digital devices such as computers, televisions, and smartphones. RGB stands for red, green, and blue, which are the primary colors used in digital displays. Each color is represented by a value between 0 and 255, with 0 indicating no intensity and 255 indicating maximum intensity.\nUsing RGB Color Codes\nRGB color codes are commonly used to specify different types of colors, including those used in web design, graphic design, and data visualization. For example, the color ‚Äúmidnightblue‚Äù can be represented by the hex code 191970 or the RGB values (25, 25, 112). In this case, the first two digits of the hex code represent the intensity of red, the second two digits represent green, and the last two digits represent blue. Similarly, the RGB values represent the intensity of red, green, and blue, respectively.\nIn data visualization, RGB color codes are often used to create choropleth maps that display different colors based on the value of a particular variable in a specific region. By using RGB color codes, users can create maps that are visually appealing and easy to interpret.\n\n\nFirst you can choose your colours by Googling a colour that you like and copying across it‚Äôs rgb code:\n\n\n\nGoogle colours\n\n\nIn this case we want three colours for three different groups. Let‚Äôs choose some from the Okabe-Ito palette.\n\n\n\n\n\nOkabe-Ito colours\n\n\n\n\nNext in Stata we import the data\n\n# set up\nclear all\nset more off\n\nuse regional_dataset, clear\n\nNow we create some groups\n\n# manual legends\n\nkeep if country == \"France\"\n\n# set groups\n\ngen groups = .\n\nreplace groups = 1 if region == \"Alsace\" |  region == \"Champagne-Ardenne\" | ///\n    region == \"Bretagne\" | ///\n    region == \"Franche-Comt√©\" | region == \"Languedoc-Roussillon\" | ///\n    region == \"Lorraine\" | region == \"Midi-Pyr√©n√©es\" | region == \"Nord - Pas-de-Calais\" | ///\n    region == \"Provence-Alpes-C√¥te d'Azur\" | region == \"Corse\" | region == \"Picardie\"\n\nreplace groups = 2 if region == \"Aquitaine\" | region == \"Auvergne\" | region == \"Basse-Normandie\" | ///\n    region == \"Bourgogne\" | ///\n    region == \"Centre\" | region == \"Centre\" | region == \"Centre\" | region == \"Centre\" | ///\n    region == \"Haute-Normandie\" | region == \"Limousin\" | region == \"Pays de la Loire\" | ///\n    region == \"Poitou-Charentes\" | region == \"Rh√¥ne-Alpes\"\n\nreplace groups = 3 if region == \"√éle de France\"\n\nNow we can map the data, putting our RGB colour codes into the fcolor command: fcolor(\"230 159 0\" \"86 180 233\" \"0 158 115\"). In addition, we label our groups in the legend and set appropriate breaks with the clbreaks command.\n\n# Orange: \"230 159 0\"\n# Blue: \"86 180 233\"\n# Green: \"0 158 115\"\n\n\n # Put the rgb values for the colours into the `fcolor` command, and then put the labels into the legend.\nspmap groups using \"nutscoord.dta\" if year == 1950, id(_ID) fcolor(\"230 159 0\" \"86 180 233\" \"0 158 115\") legend(pos(9)) legstyle(2) ///\n    title(\"Regional GDP per Capita - 1950\", size(medium)) ///\n    osize(0.02 ..) ocolor(white ..) /// \n    clmethod(custom) clbreaks(0 1 2 3) ///\n    legend(order(2 \"MLP\" 3 \"EM\" 4 \"JLM\"))\n\nThis is what the map looks like:\n\n\n\nMap of France with regions"

    "text": "Moran‚Äôs I\nQ: How do I calculate Moran‚Äôs I in Stata?\nA: We need to calculate the spatial weighting matrix, and then calculate Moran‚Äôs I.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMoran‚Äôs I\n\n\n\nMoran‚Äôs I is a measure of spatial autocorrelation‚Äìhow related the values of a variable are based on the locations where they were measured. In other words, global spatial autocorrelation measures the extent to which regions are interdependent.\n\n\nTo calculate Moran‚Äôs I, first we need to calculate the spatial weighting matrix. This matrix shows us how far each region is away from every other region. To calculate this matrix, we need to find the midpoint of each region. There are multiple ways to do this, but we will go with the simplest, which is to take the mean of all of the coordinates that make up the polygon.\nWe install the user written command that allows us to calculate the spatial weighting matrix sg162.\n\nclear all\nset more off\n\n # Install required user written command\nssc install sg162\n\nNext we find the mean x and y coordinates of each region and join this to our data from the regional_dataset.\n\nuse nutscoord, clear \nbysort _ID: egen mean_x = mean(_X)\nbysort _ID: egen mean_y = mean(_Y)\nkeep _ID mean_x mean_y\nduplicates drop\nmerge 1:m _ID using regional_dataset\nkeep if _merge == 3\ndrop _merge\n\nNext we choose a year to calculate Moran‚Äôs I for:\n\nkeep if year == 2000\n\nAnd calculate the spatial weighting matrix with the spatwmat command.\nThe band option allows us to drop any outliers which are too far away to be considered neighbours. We include all regions by setting the band‚Äôs upper bound very high.\n\nspatwmat, name(nutsweights) xcoord(mean_x) ycoord(mean_y) band(0 1.2e+06 )\n\nThe output that we get looks like this:\n\n\n\nSpatial weighting matrix output\n\n\nTo calculate Moran‚Äôs I for 2010 with regional GDP per capita, we use the weights we have calculated and the following command:\n\nspatgsa regional_gdp_cap_1990, weights(nutsweights) moran\n\nThe output looks like this:\n\n\n\nMoran‚Äôs I calculation output\n\n\nBased on these results, we can reject the null hypothesis that there is zero spatial autocorrelation present in the variable regional_gdp_cap_1990 at alpha = .05. In other words, regional GDP per capita is related to geography in 2010."

    "text": "Graphing\nLet‚Äôs get started!\n\nLoad data\nAs before we will use the regional_dataset.dta file saved in our working directories.\n\ncd \"C:/Users/User/Documents/Recon/EOSE09/stata_files/\" # set your directory\nuse regional_dataset, clear\n\n\n\nScatter plots\nScatterplots show the extent of correlation between two variables (on the x- and y-axes). Including colour and shaped markers can allow us to compare groups of data.\nWe can draw a basic scatter plot in stata:\n\ngraph twoway scatter regional_gdp_cap_1990 year if region == \"Stockholm\"\n\n\nWe can add a line of best fit with a quadratic curve by using the qfit or quadratic fit command. Notice that we are layering two plots on one set of axes (the scatter plot and the line of best fit) with the twoway command. In addition we add some labels and format the y-axis.\n\ngraph twoway (scatter regional_gdp_cap_1990 year if region == \"Stockholm\") ///\n             (qfit regional_gdp_cap_1990 year if region == \"Stockholm\") ///\n                     ,legend(order(1 \"Stockholm\" 2 \"Quadratic fit\")) ///\n                     ylabel(,format(%9.0fc)) ///\n                     ytitle(Regional GDP per capita in 1990 International Dollars)\n\n\n\n\nLine plots\nLine plots are great for showing trends over time.\nWe can draw a basic line plot with the line command in Stata:\n\nline regional_gdp_cap_1990 year if region == \"Stockholm\"         \n\n\nAgain we can use the twoway command to plot different regions on our line plot. The legend provided by Stata is not super helpful, either in its information or placement.\n\ngraph twoway (line regional_gdp_cap_1990 year if region == \"Stockholm\") ///\n             (line regional_gdp_cap_1990 year if region == \"Sydsverige\") ///\n                   (line regional_gdp_cap_1990 year if region == \"V√§stsverige\")\n\n\nWe can change that by specifying labels in our legend with the legend option and placement with the pos option.\n\ngraph twoway (line regional_gdp_cap_1990 year if region == \"Stockholm\") ///\n             (line regional_gdp_cap_1990 year if region == \"Sydsverige\") ///\n                   (line regional_gdp_cap_1990 year if region == \"V√§stsverige\") ///\n                  ,legend(order(1 \"Stockholm\" 2 \"Sydsverige\" 3 \"V√§stsverige\") /// \n                  ring(0) pos(5)) ylabel(,format(%9.0fc))\n\n\n\n\nBar plots\nBar plots are a great way to show compaisons between groups.\nFirst we create a variable to select three regions in our plot with the gen command:\n\ngen include_in_bar = .\nreplace include_in_bar = 1 if region == \"London Counties\" | region == \"Wales\" | region == \"Northern Ireland\" \n\nThen we can draw a basic bar graph. Here the variables we want to compare are named before the if command specifies which segment of the data we want to use. The over option tells Stata that we want to use of bar graph to compare different regions.\n\ngraph bar employment_share_agriculture employment_share_industry ///\nemployment_share_services if include_in_bar == 1 & year == 1900 ///\n,over(region) \n\n\nWe can turn this into a stacked bar graph that makes it easier to compare the proportions between regions (as by definition they must sum to 100 percent) with the stack option.\n\ngraph bar employment_share_agriculture employment_share_industry ///\nemployment_share_services if include_in_bar == 1 & year == 1900 ///\n,over(region) stack \n\n\nFinally we can add some nice labels, a y-axis that makes sense and a title:\n\ngraph bar employment_share_agriculture employment_share_industry ///\nemployment_share_services if include_in_bar == 1 & year == 1900 ///\n    ,over(region) stack title(Employment Composition in 1900) ///\n    legend(order(1 \"Agriculture\" 2 \"Industry\" 3 \"Services\")) ///\n    ylab(0 \"0\" .25 \"25\" .5 \"50\" .75 \"75\" 1 \"100\") ///\n    ytitle(\"Employment share (percent)\")\n\n\nI hope that this is useful!"

It can also provide tips and tricks for customizing and formatting your graphs, such as adding labels, changing colors, and adjusting axis scales.\nFor econometrics in Stata, ChatGPT can help you to understand different types of econometric models, such as linear regression, panel data models, time series models, and limited dependent variable models. It can also provide guidance on how to conduct hypothesis testing, interpret results, and report findings.\nIn addition, ChatGPT can assist with providing examples and explanations of Stata commands and syntax, allowing you to quickly apply the information you learn to your own data analysis.\nOverall, ChatGPT can be a useful resource for supplementing your learning of graphing and econometrics in Stata by providing explanations, examples, and guidance, making it easier for you to understand and apply the concepts in your own work."

Here are the labels for each of them, as you can use in Stata.\n\nlabel variable country \"Full-length country name\"\nlabel variable GID_0 \"3-digits ISO-Code\"\nlabel variable region \"Primary region name\"\nlabel variable GID_1 \"GADM-identifier for level-1 administrative unit, or customly created identifier\"\nlabel variable year \"Calendar year\"\nlabel variable grp_lcu \"Gross regional product in local currency and current prices\"\nlabel variable pop \"Regional population estimate\"\nlabel variable grp_pc_lcu \"Gross regional product per capita in local currency and current prices\"\nlabel variable grp_pc_usd \"Gross regional product per capita in US dollar and current prices\"\nlabel variable grp_pc_lcu_2015 \"Gross regional product per capita in local currency and 2015 prices\"\nlabel variable grp_pc_usd_2015 \"Gross regional product per capita in US dollar and US 2015 prices\"\nlabel variable grp_pc_lcu2015_usd \"Gross regional product per capita in local 2015 prices and converted to US dollar using the 2015 exchange rate\"\nlabel variable cpi_2015 \"Worldbank Consumer Price Index with base year 2015\"\nlabel variable deflator_2015 \"Worldbank national GDP deflator with base year 2015\"\nlabel variable fx \"FRED market exchange rate (local currency to one USD)\"\nlabel variable PPP \"Purchasing Power Parity exchange rate (local currency to one international dollar)\"\nlabel variable StructChange \"Categorical variable indicating the start of a new data source, changes in administrative boundaries, and when regional time series were extended to a previous version of DOSE\"\nlabel variable T_a \"Area-weighted annual mean temperature\"\nlabel variable P_a \"Area-weighted annual total precipitation\"\n\n\n\nData coverage\nNot every country has data for every year. Here is a plot showing the data coverage for a selection of half of the countries in the dataset.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: GDP per capita\nWe might want to plot the evolution of gross regional product per capita in South African and Mozambique to contrast with Sweden and Finland.\nWe want to know what the names of the regions are first:\n\n\nReading layer `dose_v2_map_file' from data source \n  `/Users/jonathanjayes/Documents/PhD/EOSE09-site/data/dose_v2_map_file.shp' \n  using driver `ESRI Shapefile'\nSimple feature collection with 1602 features and 11 fields\nGeometry type: MULTIPOLYGON\nDimension:     XY\nBounding box:  xmin: -179.9984 ymin: -55.9797 xmax: 179.9979 ymax: 83.11042\nGeodetic CRS:  WGS 84\n\n\n\n\n\nNext we can create a facet plot and fill the polygons with the GRP per capita in 2000, 2004, 2008, 2012, and 2016."
