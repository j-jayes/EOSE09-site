        "\n",
        "üó∫Ô∏è One goal of this course is to teach students how to identify a good map -- one which is clear, informative and attractive -- and familiarise students with the commands which allow the creation of these maps in Stata.üìà\n",
        "\n",
        "In addition, your lab paper (üìÖ due March 3rd) requires that you include at least 6 maps, so it is worth concentrating in the labs and making use of these resources.üìù\n",
        "\n",
        "üìö This document is intended to allow you to keep up with the Stata Lab 1 that we will work through in class.üìä\n",
        "\n",
        "You can read the document on this website, or download the same information in [pdf format hereüìö](Lab-1.pdf).\n",
        "\n",
        "It will include the commands the we use and the output, as well as some hints and tips that will be useful during your projects, I hope.ü§û\n",

        "## Structure\n",
        "\n",
        "Today we will be covering the following topics:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  Installing basic packages: We will go over how to install the necessary packages in order to run our analysis. This will include packages such as \"spmap\" and \"geo2xy\" which will allow us to create maps in Stata.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  Data types: We will discuss the different types of data that we will be working with in this lab. Specifically, we will be using time series data from a spreadsheet and map data from a shapefile. It is important to understand the structure and format of these data types in order to properly analyze and visualize them.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  Basic mapping: Once we have our data, we will learn how to draw a basic map using the \"maps\" and \"maptools\" packages. We will go over how to import the shapefile data, how to define the map scale, and how to add different layers to the map such as points, lines, and polygons.\n",
        "\n",
        "By the end of this lab, you should have a solid understanding of how to install necessary packages, how to work with different types of data, and how to draw a basic map in Stata.\n",

        "\n",
        "The process of combining these two types of data is called \"joining\" or \"merging\" and it allows us to link the attributes from the spreadsheet to the geographic features in the shapefile.

        "\n",
        "-   .shp (shapefile): This file stores the actual geometric data for the features in the map, such as the shape of a street or a building.\n",

        "\n",
        "-   .prj (projection file): This file stores information about the coordinate system and projection used for the data in the shapefile. This is important for ensuring that the map is displayed correctly and that measurements are accurate.\n",
